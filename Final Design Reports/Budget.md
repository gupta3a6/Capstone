I am interested in capstone projects that leverage data analytics, machine learning, and software development to solve real-world problems. Projects that involve analyzing large datasets, building predictive models, and creating actionable insights are particularly appealing. I am also drawn to projects that integrate interactive dashboards, business intelligence tools, or full-stack applications to deliver user-centered solutions.
